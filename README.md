# TFG: _Deep Learning techniques applied to prediction from images. Use case: pet’s adoption_

This repository contains my [Undergraduate Dissertation](https://github.com/damogad/TFG/blob/main/TFG_David_Mora.pdf) (graded 10/10 with honours, also awarded with the UCLM - Aula Oesía's best undergraduate thesis project in Data Science) for those interested in my work. Moreover, I have also included the [presentation](https://github.com/damogad/TFG/blob/main/TFG_Presentacion_David_Mora.pdf) I used, which is an overall summary of the work.

The development of this work was completely carried out in Kaggle. The following are the hyperlinks to the notebooks of each part of the project:
