# TFG: _Deep Learning techniques applied to prediction from images. Use case: pet’s adoption_

This repository contains my [Undergraduate Dissertation](https://github.com/damogad/TFG/blob/main/TFG_David_Mora.pdf) for those interested in my work.

The development of this work was completely carried out in Kaggle. The following are the hyperlinks to the notebooks of each part of the project:
